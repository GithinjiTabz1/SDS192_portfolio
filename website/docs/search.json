    "text": "Colleges Admission Rates\nHow do the cost of attendance, and admission rates differ between public and private colleges in Massachusetts for the year 2018?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog post\nIn this blog post, we delve into the admission rates and costs of attendance for colleges in Massachusetts. We used data from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive dataset produced by the U.S. Department of Education. This dataset provides information on various metrics related to higher education institutions, including tuition costs, graduation rates, and admission statistics. For our analysis, we focused specifically on the year 2018, examining how admission rates and costs of attendance differ between public universities, private nonprofit universities, and private profit universities. Our findings are illustrated through two visualizations: a histogram depicting admission rates and a jitter plot showcasing costs of attendance.\nThe first visualization, a histogram, reveals important insights into the distribution of admission rates among Massachusetts colleges. From the histogram, we observe that public universities generally exhibit higher admission rates, clustering between 70% and 90%, while private nonprofit universities display a wider range of admission rates, with many institutions falling below 60%. This indicates that public universities tend to be more accessible to a broader demographic of applicants compared to their private counterparts. The faceting of the histogram by university type allows us to easily compare these patterns, highlighting the distinct roles that public and private institutions play in the higher education landscape.\nOur second visualization is a jitter plot that provides a clearer picture on the costs of attendance for these colleges. The plot illustrates that public universities typically have lower costs compared to private nonprofit and private profit institutions. By representing the cost of attendance on the y-axis and the type of university on the x-axis, the plot reveals that many public colleges offer a more affordable option for students. The use of jittering helps to visualize the concentration of costs within each category, showcasing the financial accessibility of each type of institution.\nThe key takeaway from our analysis is the difference in both admission rates and costs of attendance between public and private colleges in Massachusetts. Public universities generally provide higher admission rates and lower costs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In contrast, private nonprofit and private profit institutions often have more selective admission processes and higher tuition fees, which may limit access for some students. However, it is crucial to approach this data with ethical considerations in mind. One primary concern is the representation of marginalized student groups in the dataset. While the College Scorecard provides valuable insights, it may not fully capture the unique barriers faced by students from low-income backgrounds or underrepresented communities. Furthermore, the dataset relies heavily on quantitative metrics, which can overlook qualitative aspects of students’ experiences and the broader context of their educational journeys.\nIn summary, our visualizations of admission rates and costs of attendance among Massachusetts colleges underscore important trends in accessibility and affordability. As we analyze such datasets, it is essential to remain aware of the ethical implications and potential biases inherent in the data collection process. This ensures that our findings contribute to a more equitable understanding of higher education access and opportunities for all students.\nIn this blog post, we delve into the admission rates and costs of attendance for colleges in Massachusetts, using data from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive dataset produced by the U.S. Department of Education.

cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog post\nIn the 2015-2016 election cycle, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) provided detailed data on campaign contributions from candidates, committees, and political organizations. For this analysis, we focused specifically on Massachusetts, where we aimed to explore the total amount of money spent by candidates and their committees during their campaigns. The primary question guiding this analysis was: How much did each candidate and their committees spend in Massachusetts, and did the amount of money spent influence their success in the elections?\nOur first step was to filter the dataset to include only contributions from candidates and candidate committees in Massachusetts, excluding irrelevant entries such as unreported or unknown contributions. We then calculated the total transaction amounts for four major candidates: Joe Kennedy, Stephen Lynch, Elizabeth Warren, and Edward Markey. We found that Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, both U.S. Senators, had the highest contributions, with Warren receiving $44,500 and Markey receiving $68,000. In comparison, the two congressional candidates, Joe Kennedy and Stephen Lynch, had much lower amounts, with Kennedy receiving $40,000 and Lynch receiving $9,000. These results suggest that Senate candidates generally raised more money than their congressional counterparts, which led us to explore the broader relationship between campaign spending and electoral success.\nTo further investigate, we turned our attention to the relationship between campaign spending and election outcomes. We examined how much money was disbursed by both winning and losing candidates in the 2015-2016 Senate races. Our analysis revealed a clear pattern: candidates who spent more money were more likely to win their races. When analyzing the total disbursements, it was evident that candidates who lost tended to have lower spending, while those who won had substantial campaign expenditures. This correlation highlights the importance of funding in securing electoral victories, although it also raises questions about the fairness of a system that potentially favors wealthier candidates.\nOne key takeaway from this analysis is the significant role money plays in determining the success of political candidates. While campaign contributions are necessary to run competitive campaigns, the findings underscore potential ethical concerns when joining data from different sources. For instance, when merging datasets like contributions and election results, it’s crucial to ensure that data integrity is maintained, particularly when using information from different times or data frames. There’s also a risk of data being incomplete or biased, which could skew analysis and lead to misleading conclusions. Therefore, transparency and careful data handling are essential in drawing ethical and accurate insights from such complex datasets."

    "text": "Question: How does the distribution of Chipotle stores across the United States align with state populations? Additionally, when analyzing the proportion of stores relative to the total number of Chipotle locations and adjusting for population size, what insights can we uncover about factors influencing store placement, such as population density, urbanization, or regional economic activity\n\nDistribution of Chipotle Stiores across the US\nThis map displays the distribution of Chipotle stores across the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we aim to visualize the proportion of Chipotle stores in each state across the United States. To achieve this, we first create a population map to provide context and to ensure we don’t create the population map again.\n\n\nUS population map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we create a map displaying the proportion of Chipotle stores in each state relative to the total number of stores across the United States.\n\n\nMap for Proportion of Chipotle stores relative to total stores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot created, it is evident that the map closely resembles a population map, as it shows a similar distribution pattern across the states.\nTo create a map that accounts for population differences, we calculate the number of Chipotle stores per million residents in each state.\n\n\nMap for Chipotle stores per million residents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog post\nIn this project, we explored the distribution of Chipotle restaurants across the United States using geospatial analysis. Leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, which provides the location of every Chipotle restaurant in the country, we sought to understand the company’s location strategy. The dataset was uploaded by Jeffrey Braun, a UChicago graduate, who claimed to have scraped the data from the Chipotle website. (Braun 2020). Specifically, we aimed to analyze how Chipotle store locations are distributed in relation to state populations and to investigate whether store concentration correlates with population density.\nWe began by visualizing the locations of Chipotle restaurants on a U.S. map. This involved converting the dataset into a spatial format, enabling us to plot the coordinates of each store. The visualization revealed that Chipotle locations are primarily concentrated in urban centers, with states like California, New York, and Texas hosting the most stores. These states, with their high population densities and large urban hubs like Los Angeles, New York City, and Houston, naturally align with a higher number of Chipotle locations. To assess how population influences store distribution, we created a population map of the United States. This step was crucial as it provided a baseline for comparing the distribution of Chipotle locations to population data. From there, we developed a custom function to calculate each state’s proportion of Chipotle stores relative to the national total. Using this data, we created a choropleth map that graphically represented the store proportions, offering a clear depiction of states with higher or lower concentrations of Chipotle locations. The resulting map closely mirrored the population map, suggesting that states with larger populations generally host more Chipotle stores. However, we wanted to investigate further to determine if less-populated states had a comparable number of stores per million residents to more populous states.\nWe then took our analysis a step further by considering population-adjusted metrics. Recognizing that absolute store counts alone do not account for state population differences, we integrated U.S. Census data to calculate the number of Chipotle stores per million residents in each state. This approach allowed us to explore whether smaller states with lower populations had comparable store density to larger, more populous states. Using this new proportion, we created another choropleth map to visualize the distribution of Chipotle stores on a per-capita basis, offering a more balanced view of store density relative to population size. The population-adjusted analysis highlights interesting patterns. States with, such as Minnesota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, have a proportionally higher number of Chipotle stores per capita, even if their total store counts are relatively modest. On the other hand, some highly populated states have a relatively lower store density per capita, despite hosting a large number of locations overall. This suggests that Chipotle’s placement strategy is not solely driven by population size but also considers other factors such as high-traffic urban centers, economic activity, and potentially regional preferences.\nOur findings align with insights from Jordan Bean’s study, which highlights Chipotle’s strategic focus on urban centers in high-density areas while also noting a recent shift toward suburban areas (Bean 2023). This strategic adaptation may reflect evolving trends, such as population migration and hybrid work patterns, as Chipotle seeks to expand its reach into new markets.\nIn conclusion, this project highlights the value of integrating geospatial and demographic analysis to understand business strategies. By creating maps that account for both absolute store counts and population-adjusted metrics, we uncovered patterns that reveal the brand’s strategic focus on urban areas and densely populated states. These findings can help inform business decisions of Chipotle and other brands, from identifying growth opportunities to refining location strategies. Lastly, this project highlights how geospatial tools and demographic data in R can be applied to real-world problems, offering practical insights for optimizing retail operations and enhancing strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBean, Jordan. 2023. “Beyond the Burrito: The Analytics Behind Chipotle’s Location Strategy.” Medium, May. https://jordanbean.medium.com/the-analytics-behind-chipotles-location-strategy-2d91a23fd66.\n\n\nBraun, Jeffrey. 2020. “Chipotle Locations: A CSV File for All Chipotle Locations in the US.” https://www.kaggle.com/jeffreybraun/chipotle-locations."

We used data from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive dataset produced by the U.S. Department of Education. This dataset provides information on various metrics related to higher education institutions, including tuition costs, graduation rates, and admission statistics. For our analysis, we focused specifically on the year 2018, examining how admission rates and costs of attendance differ between public universities, private nonprofit universities, and private profit universities. Our findings are illustrated through two visualizations: a histogram depicting admission rates and a jitter plot showcasing costs of attendance.\nThe first visualization, a histogram, reveals important insights into the distribution of admission rates among Massachusetts colleges. From the histogram, we observe that public universities generally exhibit higher admission rates, clustering between 70% and 90%, while private nonprofit universities display a wider range of admission rates, with many institutions falling below 60%. This indicates that public universities tend to be more accessible to a broader demographic of applicants compared to their private counterparts. The faceting of the histogram by university type allows us to easily compare these patterns, highlighting the distinct roles that public and private institutions play in the higher education landscape.\nOur second visualization is a jitter plot that provides a clearer picture on the costs of attendance for these colleges. The plot illustrates that public universities typically have lower costs compared to private nonprofit and private profit institutions. By representing the cost of attendance on the y-axis and the type of university on the x-axis, the plot reveals that many public colleges offer a more affordable option for students. The use of jittering helps to visualize the concentration of costs within each category, showcasing the financial accessibility of each type of institution.\nThe key takeaway from our analysis is the difference in both admission rates and costs of attendance between public and private colleges in Massachusetts. Public universities generally provide higher admission rates and lower costs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In contrast, private nonprofit and private profit institutions often have more selective admission processes and higher tuition fees, which may limit access for some students. However, it is crucial to approach this data with ethical considerations in mind. One primary concern is the representation of marginalized student groups in the dataset. While the College Scorecard provides valuable insights, it may not fully capture the unique barriers faced by students from low-income backgrounds or underrepresented communities. Furthermore, the dataset relies heavily on quantitative metrics, which can overlook qualitative aspects of students’ experiences and the broader context of their educational journeys.\nIn summary, our visualizations of admission rates and costs of attendance among Massachusetts colleges underscore important trends in accessibility and affordability. As we analyze such datasets, it is essential to remain aware of the ethical implications and potential biases inherent in the data collection process. This ensures that our findings contribute to a more equitable understanding of higher education access and opportunities for all students.\nIn this blog post, we delve into the admission rates and costs of attendance for colleges in Massachusetts, using data from the College Scorecard, a comprehensive dataset produced by the U.S. Department of Education.
