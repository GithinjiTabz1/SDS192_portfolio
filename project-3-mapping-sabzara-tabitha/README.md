# Project-3

In this third project you and your partner will create twos maps from data that you find on the internet. I encourage you to find data that you are interested in and is not too difficult to understand. Finding Data is not hard, but understanding it can be challenging. 

# Find a partner:

You are to work with a new partner of your choosing for the third project. Once you have a partner you can go onto github classroom and create a team that your partner can join. If you need help finding a partner or would rather me pair you with someone, please let me know soon. 

Ideally you will have your partner by Monday and data by the end of class on Monday.

# Components: 

As with the last project you will form a question then wrangle data to answer that question. It is okay to alter your question as you learn more about your data. You will produce two maps (which can be static or dynamic). 

In addition to your maps your project will incorporate at least one of the three elements below: 

-  Some iteration with a function like map().
-  Creation of a custom function.
-  Pivoting a data frame.

You will also need to produce a short write up explaining what you have learned about your data and things that are interesting in it. 

It is important that you render and push all files related to your maps. If you do not include the html files that go with your maps I will not be able to see them. 

# Citation:

You will need to cite your data's source. In addition to your data you will likely have to read some articles for domain knowledge, any of those that are referenced should be cited as well.
